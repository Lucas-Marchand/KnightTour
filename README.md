KnightTour is a java implementation of solving the KnightTour problem using depth first search and two heuristic
search algorithms that are designed to optimize searching. KnightTour is the driver program that takes in four arguments.
This program will output to the console a solution if any to the KnightTour given a heuristic to use (0/1/2) board size (n),
a start x location (x),and a start y location (y). Otherwise the program will tell the user that it is unsolveable.

In terminal:

javac KnightTour.java
java KnightTour <0/1/2> (none/heuristicI/heuristicII) <n> <x> <y> (where all arguments are integers)
